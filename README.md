**Design Studio Project**

Inital Project upload that includes a start screen, loading screen, intro level, and credits. 

Current primary controls for 2 players are split keyboard, wasd/arrow keys and abilities using 1 & 2 for player 1 and 8 & 9 for player 2, with some joystick/button functionality. 

Goals:
1. Primary: add leapmotion functionality for hand/gesture controls for abilities 
2. Secondary: Build out levels, finish credits 
3. Tertiary: optimization
